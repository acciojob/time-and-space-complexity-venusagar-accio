	<h1>Concepts of Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a type of computational complexity that describes the time required to execute an algorithm,and should be time efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution,O(n)</b></p>
